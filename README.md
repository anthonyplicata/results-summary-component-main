## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

I have a better understanding of how to use Bootstrap for responsive webpages. My first round of doing this challenge was a mess and nothing seemed to work. With Bootstrap I had a much better visual understanding of the field and how the page changes per user's screen. 

### Continued development

I need to focus on quite a lot, but I feel great about how I figure out how to do this challenge without any tutorial assistance. I know I need to continue to learn responsivity better because there are certainly some things not right.
